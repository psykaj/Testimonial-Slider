Project Description :- 

1) I made a simple and neat Testimonial Slider with React.js 

2) This slider can be used on any website to showcase your users' praise in a sleek and captivating way to provide credibility to your work.

3) This slider also has a "𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐞" button to add some excitement, when the user checks the reviews.

4) Check out the component and apply it directly to your website 

5) This can also serve as a great assignment for anyone who is a beginner in react.js.
